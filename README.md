# Reminder
The Latin cogito, ergo sum, usually translated into English as "I think, therefore I am", is the "first principle" of Ren√© Descartes's philosophy. He originally published it in French as je pense, donc je suis in his 1637 Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed.
